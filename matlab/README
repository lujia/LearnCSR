These are Matlab functions reading sparse matrices 

This directory contains:

1. readunf_for.m

Read unformatted binary files for CSR matrix. It is not recommended due to two reasons: 
     * Easy to make mistakes, difficult to check binary file
     * Difficult to share between different systems 

2. readIJ.m

Read ASCII file for IJ matrix. Recommended. 

3. checkmat.m

Test code for checking i/o. There is also a test sparse matrix in CSR and IJ format.
